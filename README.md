Sum of four cubes problem

Hi!
I'm Arshak Parsa!

I'm interested in this problem and I want to 
find a proof by bruteforce!
My goal is to find an algorithm that gets 
an integer N and returns 4 integers in a way
that if you add the cubes of these 4 integers
, you get N !
I want to find the solution in O(1)!

Have fun! :)
